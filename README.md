QuickNavigator
==============

a chrome extension for quick navigate. This is inspired by [Vimum](http://vimium.github.io/), and I did some enhancements.
When user type some key words in omnibox, it will give you all relevant urls including your history,bookmarks,popdomains and so on.

###Features
1. Support multiple suggestion source, including bookmarks,history,popdomain
2. Support pinyin search, which is more convenient for chinese.
3. Support url relevancy. There are a lot of rules to make sure the url that omnibox gived is the most relevant. Say, you select url a after you type twitter, the second time you type twitter, url a will displayed in front position.
4. Support more functions, more than urls. 
    * Recently Closed Tab. Type "u" in the omnibox.
    * Close Quick Navigator in current page. Type "c" in the omnibox.
    * Every search will give baidu(google) suggestions in the end of the suggestions list.
