QuickNavigator
==============

a chrome extension for quick navigate. This is inspired by [Vimum](http://vimium.github.io/), and I did some enhancements.
When user type some key words in omnibox, it will give you all relevant urls including your history,bookmarks,popdomains and so on.

###Features
1. Support multiple suggestion source, including bookmarks,history,popdomain
2. Support pinyin search, which is more convenient for chinese.
3. Support advanced mode. Something like you type u in the omnibox and then type tab, omnibox will give you your unclosed tabs recently. (didn't implement yet)
